A set of utility methods that can be invoked from a CLI.

## Building

To get the js source generated form coffee script:

``` bash
$ grunt coffee
```

This will put all js files in `lib` folder.

## Testing

To execute tests, make sure
[grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) is installed. Then run:

``` bash
$ grunt test
```

Before testing, this task will perform a lint check using
[coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org/).  Tests will be executed if and
only if linting succeeds.

The `default` task of `grunt` will run this command as well. So, just
typing `grunt` and pressing RET is also sufficient to run tests.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using
[docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) and placed in `docs`
folder. To build documentation:

``` bash
$ grunt docs
```

## Build + Test + Document

The `build` task of `grunt` will check linting, test everything,
generate docs and build javascript source. So, to execute:

``` bash
$ grunt build
```
